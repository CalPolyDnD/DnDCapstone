Syntax-highlighting, declarative and composable pretty printer for Python 3.5+

.. code:: bash

    pip install prettyprinter

- Drop in replacement for the standard library ``pprint``: just rename ``pprint`` to ``prettyprinter`` in your imports.
- Uses a modified Wadler-Leijen layout algorithm for optimal formatting
- Write pretty printers for your own types with a dead simple, declarative interface

Pretty print common Python values:

.. code:: python

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from prettyprinter import pprint
    >>> pprint({'beautiful output': datetime.now()})
    {
        'beautiful output': datetime.datetime(
            year=2017,
            month=12,
            day=12,
            hour=0,
            minute=43,
            second=4,
            microsecond=752094
        )
    }

As well as your own, without any manual string formatting:

.. code:: python

    >>> class MyClass:
    ...     def __init__(self, one, two):
    ...         self.one = one
    ...         self.two = two

    >>> from prettyprinter import register_pretty, pretty_call

    >>> @register_pretty(MyClass)
    ... def pretty_myclass(value, ctx):
    ...     return pretty_call(ctx, MyClass, one=value.one, two=value.two)

    >>> pprint(MyClass((1, 2, 3), {'a': 1, 'b': 2}))
    MyClass(one=(1, 2, 3), two={'a': 1, 'b': 2})

    >>> pprint({'beautiful output': datetime.now(), 'beautiful MyClass instance': MyClass((1, 2, 3), {'a': 1, 'b': 2})})
    {
        'beautiful MyClass instance': MyClass(
            one=(1, 2, 3),
            two={'a': 1, 'b': 2}
        ),
        'beautiful output': datetime.datetime(
            year=2017,
            month=12,
            day=12,
            hour=0,
            minute=44,
            second=18,
            microsecond=384219
        )
    }

Comes packaged with the following pretty printer definitions:

- ``datetime`` - (installed by default)
- ``enum`` - (installed by default)
- ``pytz`` - (installed by default)
- ``dataclasses`` - any new class you create will be pretty printed automatically
- ``attrs`` - any new class you create will be pretty printed automatically
- ``django`` - your Models and QuerySets will be pretty printed automatically
- ``requests`` - automatically pretty prints Requests, Responses, Sessions, and more from the ``requests`` library

=======
History
=======

0.14.0 (2018-07-25)
-------------------

Most likely no breaking changes.

* Added definitions for ``pathlib`` standard library module thanks to GitHub user ``RazerM``
* Fixed unexpected error output inside Jupyter notebooks thanks to GitHub user ``jdanbrown``
* Fixed missing commas in ``setup.py`` requirements list

0.13.2 (2018-05-29)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Fixed the dataclasses pretty printer that had regressed after changes to the dataclasses API. Fix was contributed by GitHub user ``dangirsh``.

0.13.1 (2018-02-03)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Fixed GH issue #17 where Django models showed an incorrect display name for fields with choices.

0.13.0 (2018-02-03)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Added definitions for the ``ast`` standard library module thanks to GitHub user ``johnnoone``.

0.12.0 (2018-01-22)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Added a definition for classes that look like they were built with ``collections.namedtuple``
* If a pretty printer raises an exception, it is caught and emitted as a warning, and the default repr implementation will be used instead.
* Added definitions for ``collections.ChainMap``, ``collections.defaultdict``, ``collections.deque``, ``functools.partial``, and for exception objects.
* Made pretty printers for primitive types (dict, list, set, etc.) render a subclass constructor around them


0.11.0 (2018-01-20)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Added Python 3.5 support
* Added ``pretty_call_alt`` function that doesn't depend on ``dict`` maintaining insertion order
* Fixed bug in ``set_default_config`` where most configuration values were not updated
* Added ``get_default_config``

0.10.1 (2018-01-10)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Fixed regression with types.MappingProxyType not being properly registered.

0.10.0 (2018-01-09)
-------------------

No breaking changes.

* Added support for deferred printer registration, where instead of a concrete type value, you can pass a qualified path to a type as a ``str`` to ``register_pretty``. For an example, see `the deferred printer registration for uuid.UUID <https://github.com/tommikaikkonen/prettyprinter/blob/05187126889ade1c2bf0557a40800e5c44a32bab/prettyprinter/pretty_stdlib.py#L38-L40>`_

0.9.0 (2018-01-03)
------------------

No breaking changes.

* Added pretty printer definition for ``types.MappingProxyType`` thanks to GitHub user `Cologler <https://github.com/Cologler/>`_
* Added support for ``_repr_pretty_`` in the extra ``ipython_repr_pretty``.


0.8.1 (2018-01-01)
------------------

* Fixed issue #7 where having a ``str`` value for IPython's ``highlighting_style`` setting was not properly handled in ``prettyprinter``'s IPython integration, and raised an exception when trying to print data.

0.8.0 (2017-12-31)
------------------

Breaking changes:

* by default, ``dict`` keys are printed in the default order (insertion order in CPython 3.6+). Previously they were sorted like in the ``pprint`` standard library module. To let the user control this, an additional keyword argument ``sort_dict_keys`` was added to ``cpprint``, ``pprint``, and ``pformat``. Pretty printer definitions can control ``dict`` key sorting with the ``PrettyContext`` instance passed to each pretty printer function.

Non-breaking changes:

* Improved performance of rendering colorized output by caching colors.
* Added ``prettyprinter.pretty_repr`` that is assignable to ``__repr__`` dunder methods, so you don't need to write it separately from the pretty printer definition.
* Deprecated use of ``PrettyContext.set`` in favor of less misleading ``PrettyContext.assoc``
* Defined pretty printing for instances of ``type``, i.e. classes.
* Defined pretty printing for functions



0.7.0 (2017-12-23)
------------------

Breaking change: instances of lists, sets, frozensets, tuples and dicts will be truncated to 1000 elements by default when printing.

* Added pretty printing definitions for ``dataclasses``
* Improved performance of splitting strings to multiple lines by ~15%
* Added a maximum sequence length that applies to subclasses of lists, sets, frozensets, tuples and dicts. The default is 1000. There is a trailing comment that indicates the number of truncated elements. To remove truncation, you can set ``max_seq_len`` to ``None`` using ``set_default_config`` explained below.
* Added ability to change the default global configuration using ``set_default_config``. The functions accepts zero to many keyword arguments and replaces those values in the global configuration with the ones provided.

.. code:: python

    from prettyprinter import set_default_config

    set_default_config(
        style='dark',
        max_seq_len=1000,
        width=79,
        ribbon_width=71,
        depth=None,
    )

0.6.0 (2017-12-21)
------------------

No backwards incompatible changes.

* Added pretty printer definitions for the ``requests`` library. To use it, include ``'requests'`` in your ``install_extras`` call: ``prettyprinter.install_extras(include=['requests'])``.

0.5.0 (2017-12-21)
------------------

No backwards incompatible changes.

* Added integration for the default Python shell
* Wrote docs to explain integration with the default Python shell
* Check ``install_extras`` arguments for unknown extras

0.4.0 (2017-12-14)
------------------

* Revised ``comment`` to accept both normal Python values and Docs, and reversed the argument order to be more Pythonic

0.3.0 (2017-12-12)
------------------

* Add ``set_default_style`` function, improve docs on working with a light background

0.2.0 (2017-12-12)
------------------

* Numerous API changes and improvements.


0.1.0 (2017-12-07)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
