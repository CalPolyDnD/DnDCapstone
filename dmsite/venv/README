How to start the server:

<python command> manage.py runserver
ex. "py manage.py runserver"
Run from the root 'dmsite' directory (i.e. <filepath to git repo>/dmsite/venv)

Site should be located at 'localhost:8000' or '127.0.0.1:8000'

This is a dev server command, so we need to switch this later when we move to prod (I'll figure it out later...)




Alright, here's a rundown of what I think is going on with these files. In order -

'build' contains the compiled React code and other stuff related to the webpage itself.
'dmsite' contains some settings and some management stuff for the web server; you probably won't have to touch this
    except for when you're working on classification.
'node_modules' is self explanatory - was needed for setting up react.
'public' is web stuff? I guess?
'src' contains all of the source code for React, such as the JS files that end up being compiled.

The only other file to worry about is manage.py, since that's what starts the server.



In terms of making changes to the default webpage, here's what's going on:

Django redirects a base webpage call (or just a localhost call) to 'index.html' in the 'build' folder.
To make changes to the webpage, edit the 'App.js' file in the 'src' folder (i.e. repo/dmsite/venv/src) and then recompile using 'npm run build'
You need to do this every time you edit 'App.js'
Also, of note, you can keep the django server running the entire time
