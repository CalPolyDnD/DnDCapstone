\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background}
Data has become one of the biggest markets in the last decade or so. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google use data to an extreme extent.
However, while data has become a massive market, classifying groups of data sets and organizing data sets based on the data within has been almost
nonexistent. Being able to tag, organize, and search through different types of data sets would be extremely beneficial to many companies around
the world in multiple different potential ways.
\subsection{Business Opportunity}
There are very few systems present in modern technology that allow you to take multiple data sets and organize them based on the information they
contain. There's a unique opportunity to allow data sets to be organized to allow for further analysis, as well as making connections that may
have been previously unknown to companies.
\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
This product will be considered successful if:\newline
Users are able to search through collections of data sets to find data sets with similar elements.\newline
Users can classify data sets based on the data internally.\newline
The system is able to discover more and unusual data types that commonly
occur within data sets.\newline
\subsection{Customer or Market Needs}
This product is simple to use for data analysts and database managers.\newline
This product supplies a way to allow multiple data sets to be integrated into one.  This allows easier interaction with customizing the data to get desired results.\newline
\subsection{Business Risks}
Business risks involve potential losses of income. These include the following: \newline Insufficient advertising of this product could cause a problem in not enough customers.\newline
Competing companies could take away business or supply a better solution.\newline

\section{User Description}
\subsection{User/Market Demographics}
Some of the key users we expect to use this program heavily are data analyst and database managers. Others users include people who are required to search through and/or interact with large data sets often. These could include firms for organizing their clients, producers sorting through a customer databases base and in general data bases that involve people as one item.
\subsection{User Personas}
There is a Data analyst who is asked draw conclusions and categorize a local firm on its clients for property management. The clients have categories based on worth, location, list of property, priority, along with personal information. So the data Analyst would add the information into the database catalog and from there use the systems machine learning to connect and sort through the data.
\subsection{User Environment}
Our user Environment or user interface would consist of a web app. This should be multi-platformed able to be accessed through chrome, Mozilla Firefox, IE 8 or up. Our web app should be connecting the back-end with SQL and front end with JavaScript react. But for the user it should just be a website link for them to access from computer or mobile.
\subsection{Key User Needs}
Users should be able to classify and organize different data sets based on the data contained within them.\newline
Users should be able to search for data sets based on the classifications given to those data sets.\newline
Users should be able to let the program do the classification and discovery of new types of data using machine learning.\newline
Users should be able to intervene if the machine learning results in an improper classification occurs.\newline
Users should be able to interact with the program using a web-based GUI.

\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
---Product Name--- is a software suite designed to provide users with a simplistic and intuitive system that can automatically identify, classify, and organize data sets together. \newline
---Product Name--- allows for searching through collections of data sets to find sets that have similar features as well as sets that utilize similar information.\newline
Users of ---Product Name--- will be able to interact with the information gathered about the data sets via a graphical data catalog.
\subsection{Solution Overview}
---Product Name--- will consist of $<<$Some number$>>$ components. They are as follows:
\subsubsection{Data Classifier}
The data classifier will create classification models about the information found in multiple data sets. It will do so by using existing machine learning techniques. The data classifier will be built using Python 3 and will use Django(maybe) to interact with the web application.

\subsubsection{Web Application}
The web application will be where users will interact with --Product Name--. The web application will provide the users with a graphical interface where they will be able to view and interact with the information gathered by the data classifier. The web application will be built using JavaScript/Node.js.

\subsection{Major Features}
\paragraph{[FE-1]}---Product Name--- will be able to take in data sets and classify those data sets based on the type of data within them.

\paragraph{[FE-2]}---Product Name--- will be able to let users search through multiple data sets and return those that have the specified data type(s).

\paragraph{[FE-3]}---Product Name--- will use machine learning to learn and classify data sets that it had not seen previously.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
Data sets are assumed to have valid names and correct data.\newline
Data sets are assumed to be relevant to the users.\newline
Data sets are given in a commonly used format(CSV, JSON, XML).

\section{Business Context}
\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}
---Product Name--- has several different stakeholders. 
\subsubsection{MarkLogic}
---Product Name--- can be used by MarkLogic both internally and externally. MarkLogic will be able to use ---Product Name--- to serve the different data organization needs of their clients.
\subsubsection{MarkLogic Clients}
Depending on the competence of client, MarkLogic's client may be physically interacting with --Product Name---. 
\subsubsection{MarkLogic Competitors}
---Product Name--- will impact the field of data analysis businesses. Companies like MongoDB and Amazon Web Service's Glue.
\subsection{Project Priorities}
\subsubsection{Release 1}
Release 1 will focus on creating a functional web application that classifies different inputted data with categories and can output a simple overview display.
\subsubsection{Release 2}
Release 2 will focus on improving the complexity of the data classification and overall user interface. This release will spend time on creating a specific search for user's to result in different displays of the specific data they want.
\subsection{Operating Environment}
---Product Name--- will operate as a web application. It will be available online and be open source.

\section{Competitive Analysis}
\subsection{Overview}
Data analysis is a very competitive business and a very large field. As a result, the competitive environment of Data analysis is very fierce. The most prominent and current competitors to this project are Amazon Web Service's Glue, Informatica, and Alooma

\subsection{AWS's Glue}
AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue lets you collect your data sets together, manage transformations on those data sets, and then do "batch" processing on those data sets.
\subsection{Informatica}
Informatica is a cloud data management system. Working with companies such as JLL, Nissan, and Kelly Services, Informatica strives to provide analytics, foresight, and insight into the large, ever-expanding world that is Data management.
\subsection{Alooma}
Alooma is a data management company that focuses on providing data visibility, security, transparency, and versatility. Alooma makes it a proiroty to ensure that customers are aware of what they're data is doing and where it is at every step of the management process.
